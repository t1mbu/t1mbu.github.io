Currently, I'm creating a site called Redink as I want to make a unique project which would be beneficial to students, be challenging for myself, and consist of at least 1000 lines of code. I intuitively think that reorganizing information is an important process of learning as it allows you to repeatedly process information from different perspectives which will make it more likely for you to remember it and not fall asleep. This is the inspiration for the name Redink as it can be organized as "red ink" or "re(th)ink". I also think that it's important since most lectures are presented on PowerPoint slides, which force lecturers to organize information in compact slides which may not be the most optimal for organization (my point is that sometimes information may be organized to fit on a slide instead of being organized for the sake of making sense to the students). In addition, at least in the United States, reorganizing taught information is never assigned as homework (from 10 seconds of recollecting my experiences), so this may prove a novel idea. I haven't done any research as to whether this idea is indeed unique; I'm not sure how to compactly keyword my site's purpose for Googlefu.

The idea behind the site was inspired from my Sociology class. My instructor was a huge proponent of educating students using active learning methods. One day, she had everyone answer a general question about religion. Then, she categorized our responses on chalkboard, which especially made me feel like I learned something, which made me realize the potential of reorganizing information. Potentially, Redink could also be a research or project collaboration opportunity with her. Below is a snapshot of my site.

So far, all it can do is generate an outline given some notes. You can see some user input in a box, and a generated outline below the submit button. Yet, I'm already feeling tired of making it; just this simple feature was especially taxing for me. Plus, I don't think I've reached 1000 lines of code (feels around 400-500). Just debugging code sapped a lot of my energy as the algorithm to generate the outline was simple but unintuitive. I'm going to persevere through this though for the sake of impact it could potentially make. Also, this blog allows me to vent out my frustrations which will force me to describe my problems and make them clearer for me to solve.

The next step for the site will be generating the differences between two outlines and displaying them in a manner which is understandable by the user; I have not thought this through very hard. It, again, is not intuitive for me to approach. Who knows -- maybe I won't be able to solve it, which makes me the owner of another dead project. My project is currently present on [Github](https://github.com/t1mbu/redink) in case this is the last time I write about it.
