title: Winter break
---

Currently, I'm on winter break and roughly a week has passed. I've been staying up to 5 AM because I don't have self-control. I've spent a lot of time playing blitz and bullet chess which doesn't benefit me in any way. This pattern of self-destruction has got to end, and I aim to quit chess tomorrow and only concentrate on work. I know to study HackTheBox and work on Redink so that is what I will only do.
