I have the sudden urge to write what I learn everyday which means I probably won't because it's sudden. Because I don't have the luxury of talking or writing to people everyday, this is the perfect manner in which I can exercise my social skills. I'm also interested in improving and analyzing my writing. I change my identity on the Internet every 6-12 months; this is my new identity and with this change I want to take advantage of an opportunity to instill some good habits.
